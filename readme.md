# Canvas Quiz Auto-grader

This is my first Github project, and I know it's a mess. Sorry.

This is a Chrome extension that autofills the question grade boxes on quizzes that are graded through the [Canvas LMS](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms) SpeedGrader. I often have quizzes for which I only want to correct the answers that are wrong, so 

In development, not in the store yet. If people actually like this, plan for repo restructuring as I'll need to figure out how to actually properly structure this mess.

Thanks to the Chromium team, sample extensions and especially the [Set Page Color](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/examples/api/browserAction/set_page_color.zip) extension that got me started down this road.
